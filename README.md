# GORGAS tracker - Project: Malaria and Human Mobility in the Peruvian Amazon

The GORGAS tracker is an open-source tracking device developed by the [Health Innovation Lab](https://imtavh.cayetano.edu.pe/en/research/labs/health-innovation-laboratory.html) from The Institute of Tropical Medicine "Alexander von Humboldt". The tracking device was designed for studying people traceability and malaria transmission as part of the "Malaria and Human Mobility in the Peruvian Amazon: An evaluation of vulnerability, receptivity and malariogenic potential" project.

The GORGAS tracker is based on the [Rephone](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/RePhone/) platform (SeeedStudio) and has the following features:
* Data logging
* Geolocalization
* Programmable light alert

A PC visual interface allows users to:
* Assign an ID to the device
* Select a reference point (latitude and longitude) in the community and define a radius of interest (meters)
* Configure data logging interval and sleep period of the device
* Data visualization in a Google maps template

Understanding the relationship between malaria transmission and human mobility in diverse endemic settings is key for designing and implementing locally adapted and sustainable control and elimination strategies (Rosa-Aguirre et al., 2017).
