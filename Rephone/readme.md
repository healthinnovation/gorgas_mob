# GORGAS tracker scripts
This repository contains the scripts that run the GORGAS tracker. Rephone is an open source modular phone that supports different integrated development environments (IDE): Lua, Javascript, Arduino IDE and Eclipse IDE. Our team worked with Arduino IDE where they developed the two script versions, a simplified and an extended version.

## Before you start
We recommend you to visit [Rephone wiki documentation](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/RePhone/). There you will find information about [Arduino IDE for Rephone](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Arduino_IDE_for_RePhone_Kit/) version which contains the libraries you need to upload the code. Also you can go directly to SeeedStudio Github repository and download the [Arduino IDE](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Arduino_IDE_for_RePhone).

**Note:** If you are a Linux or iOS user, we have bad news. This Arduino IDE is only available for Windows XP/Vista/â…ž/8.1 

## Development
GORGAS tracker is based on [Rephone Geo Kit](https://www.seeedstudio.com/RePhone-Geo-Kit-p-2624.html). You must check [Xadow GSM+BLE](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/RePhone_Lumi_Kit/#xadow-gsmble) specifications and libraries first, if you want to modify the scripts.
