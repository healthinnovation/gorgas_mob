# GORGAS tracker visual interface v1.0
A graphic interface was developed on Visual Studio to visualize the datasets in a comprehensive way. The initial view was a menu with three options: GPS-tracker configuration, Map configuration and Data analysis. **Note:** The visual interface is only available in Spanish. English version soon.

GPS-tracker configuration was a section where user should select the connected device to upload a new configuration. This option has two ways to configure data loggers: default configuration and customized configuration. Default configuration has data from the last default or customized configuration. Customized configuration allows user to modify ID, latitude, longitude, radius of buffer (meters), time interval, active mode (time), and sleep mode (time).

Map configuration was a section to store offline Google maps. Users had to select a specific area (e.g. province of Maynas) and then they could download the map with Internet and store it to computer memory. These maps were useful for data analysis in the field where connectivity is limited.

The last option was Data analysis, a section to perform a preview data analysis on the field. Users could upload all GPS files on the graphic interface and they would see the offline map with location points stored and the GPS-tracker configuration. According research team needs, it was developed a functionality to simulate participants’ travels based on tracking data. The graphic interface proposed in this study is more suitable to field studies than traditional GIS software (e.g. preview datasets analysis or following study progression) but it doesn’t replace GIS for complex analysis.
