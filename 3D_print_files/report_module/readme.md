## Reporting module
In order to inspect the report of whether the participant had moved outside the boundaries of the community, a new module (RGB led and one button) and algorithm were designed. This reporting module was coupled to the extension module allowing interaction with the control module.

The colors distribution was red when the participant moved outside the boundaries, green when they were not registered movement outside the boundaries, and blue when incorrect GPS data was recorded at initialization. The button interaction distribution was one tap to verify whether the participant moved outside the boundary (red or green), and two taps to verify the correct initialization (blue).
