# GORGAS tracker STL files
This folder is for STL files that have been compiled through the build process. Here you will find different GORGAS tracker versions that we think you could use them for other applications. 3D printed parts have been carefully designed to print reliably on most RepRap-style printers, without support material or adhession layer. If your printer has a standard-sized bed (180mmx180mm should be fine) then it's possible to print the complete GORGAS tracker.

_Version 6.0 was the last design and it was tested on urban and rural settings from Iquitos, Loreto (Peru)_
